Or is this just me trying to fill out the \"blog\" section of my portfolio website, in all its dark-theme glory? Whatever this is, I'm pretty happy that I'm just doing something instead of over-planning and overthinking. Hopefully this is the start of me not being weighed down by my own goals and the pressure I put on myself to reach them. Hopefully I don't come back and edit this post and leave it is, however it may sound the next day. Hopefully this is the start of me just doing."
